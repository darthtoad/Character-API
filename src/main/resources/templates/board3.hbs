        <p>You enter the Inn, and to your dismay you see nothing but silent emptiness, and it brings a chill to your bones. However, the Inn's beds seem to be free, and I doubt anyone would mind if you were to just fall asleep for a few hours</p>

        Choose your path:
        <br>
        <a href="/game/board3.1">Take a break, drink some mead, and take a nap.</a>
        <br></br>
        <a href="/game/board3.2">Continue on your adventure</a>
        <br></br>
        <a href="/gameover">Give up. This Inn makes you realize that life isn't worth living, and you'd prefer to stay inside and live your new life in a comfortable shell.</a>
