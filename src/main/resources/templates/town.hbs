        <p>You have finally made it to {{ourLocation.name}}, the source of all evil. You see ghastly figures all around you, sending a shiver down your spine. This is it, this is the end. This is what you were preparing for. Seriously, this is it.</p>

        <a href="/gameover">Roll over and die, your weak legs can no longer support your weak body. You are weak.</a>
