        <p>: You have entered the dark and misty town of {{ourLocation.name}}. It seems mostly empty, but you notice a few lights coming from windows from the houses ahead. To your left, you notice a swinging sign that says "The {{word.name}} Inn". Ahead, you see two roads with a picketed sign in the middle, stating that the left road is the "High Roads" and the right being the "Low Roads".</p>

        Choose your path:

        <a href="/game/board2">Enter the Inn</a>
        <a href="">Continue to the High Roads</a>
        <a href="">Continue to the Low Roads</a>
        <a href="">Give up. You don't have the time to save the world.</a>
