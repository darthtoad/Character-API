        <p>You have entered the dark and misty town of {{ourLocation.name}}. It seems mostly empty, but you notice a few lights coming from windows from the houses ahead. To your left, you notice a swinging sign that says "The {{word.name}} Inn". Ahead, you see two roads with a picketed sign in the middle, stating that the left road is the "High Roads" and the right being the "Low Roads".</p>

        Choose your path:
