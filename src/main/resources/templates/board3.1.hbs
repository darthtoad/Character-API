        <p>You drink and eat to your hearts desire. Who knows when you'll have a chance to eat like this again? You slumberly lay down in a bedbug infested bed, and gently fall asleep.

        <a href="/game/board3.2">Continue on your adventure, leaving the inn.</a>
        <br></br>
        <a href="/gameover">Break down and cry. You were never meant for this kind of life.</a>
