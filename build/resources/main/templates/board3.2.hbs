        <p>You leave the Inn back into the empty town. Ahead, you see two roads with a picketed sign in the middle, stating that the left road is the "High Roads" and the right being the "Low Roads".</p>

        Choose your path:
        <br>
        <a href="/game/highroad/1/{{mage.id}}/{{fighter.id}}">Continue to the High Roads</a>
        <br></br>
        <a href="/game/highroad/1/{{mage.id}}/{{fighter.id}}">Continue to the Low Roads</a>
        <br></br>
        <a href="/gameover">Give up. It's too cold outside compared to the Inn, you can't take this.</a>
